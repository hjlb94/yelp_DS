Yelp Data Investigation

Yelp provides an easily accessible and vast repository of business review data. In this coursework, the open-source Yelp dataset is investigated to see whether the distribution of the frequencies of reviews can be used to predict the failure of a business. 

The hypotheses are:
• Failed and successful business reviews have the same frequency at the beginning of business life • As negative reviews accumulate, failed businesses receive fewer and fewer reviews
• The decay of review frequency can be used to predict if a business will fail


The dataset is taken from: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
